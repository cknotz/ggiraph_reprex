# Communicating plots with ggiraph and Shiny

This repository contains a simple reproducible example of how to set up a Shiny-app that uses one interactive `ggiraph`-plot as an input for a second interactive plot.

I describe the code in more detail in my [Medium-post](https://medium.com/@carlo.knotz/making-data-dashboard-plots-talk-to-each-other-with-ggiraph-and-shiny-460faa7b22e0).
